Governance and Security Whitepaper

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to synthesize their knowledge of governance and security in the context of the Polkadot ecosystem by creating a comprehensive whitepaper.

Instructions:

Introduction to Governance and Security: Begin by providing an overview of the importance of governance practices and network security in blockchain ecosystems, with a specific focus on Polkadot.

Topic Selection:

Assign each student or group of students a specific topic related to governance, security, or their intersection within the Polkadot ecosystem.
Suggested topics may include recent governance decisions, key governance mechanisms (e.g., referendums, council elections), security incidents, or proposed security enhancements.
Ensure students have access to relevant articles, reports, and resources related to their assigned topics.
Research and Analysis:

Instruct students to conduct in-depth research and analysis of their assigned topics.
They should explore recent governance decisions, the rationale behind them, and their implications for network security.
Encourage students to investigate how governance mechanisms are designed to maintain or enhance security within the Polkadot network.
If assigned a security incident, students should analyze the incident, the network's response, and lessons learned.
Whitepaper Writing:

Have students compile their research findings, analysis, and insights into a formal whitepaper.
The whitepaper should include sections on governance practices, security considerations, case studies (if applicable), and recommendations for enhancing network security through governance.
Encourage students to use proper citations and references for their sources.
Presentation:

Each student or group should prepare a brief presentation summarizing the key points of their whitepaper.
Presentations should be clear, concise, and engaging.
Peer Review:

Organize a peer review session where students provide constructive feedback on each other's whitepapers and presentations.
Submission and Evaluation:

Collect the whitepapers and presentations for evaluation.
Assess the whitepapers based on the depth of analysis, clarity of communication, and the practicality of the proposed recommendations.
Provide feedback and grades to students based on their submissions.
Grading Criteria:
The whitepapers and presentations will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Depth and accuracy of research and analysis.
Clarity and organization of the whitepaper.
Quality of recommendations for enhancing network security through governance.
Effectiveness of the presentation.
