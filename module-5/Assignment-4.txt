Polkadot Bridge Implementation

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in implementing a simple Polkadot bridge. Students will gain practical knowledge of how Polkadot bridges enable cross-chain communication. They will be tasked with setting up a basic Polkadot bridge that connects two test blockchains (e.g., private Ethereum testnets) and documenting the implementation process. Additionally, students will conduct a demo or showcase their functional Polkadot bridge.

Instructions:

Introduction to Polkadot Bridges: Begin by providing students with an overview of Polkadot bridges, explaining their importance in enabling cross-chain communication and interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem.

Assignment Description: Task students with implementing a basic Polkadot bridge that connects two test blockchains. You can choose Ethereum testnets for simplicity. The bridge should facilitate the transfer of assets or data between the two blockchains.

Setup and Environment:

Students should set up a development environment that includes a Polkadot node and two blockchain nodes (e.g., Ethereum nodes for the testnets).
Provide step-by-step instructions or a basic bridge framework to guide students through the setup process.
Bridge Implementation:

Instruct students to write the necessary code to create the bridge. They should focus on functionalities like asset locking, bridging, and asset unlocking.
Encourage students to document their code, explaining key components and processes within the bridge.
Testing and Debugging:

Students should thoroughly test their Polkadot bridge to ensure its functionality and correctness.
Task them with identifying and debugging any issues that may arise during testing.
Documentation:

Require students to document the entire implementation process. This documentation should include:
Detailed setup instructions for the development environment.
Code snippets and explanations of the bridge implementation.
Testing procedures and results.
Any issues encountered and their resolutions.
A summary of lessons learned during the implementation.
Demo or Showcase:

Students should conduct a demo or showcase of their functional Polkadot bridge. They can use sample transactions to demonstrate the bridge's operation.
Submission:

Students should submit their documentation, code, and any additional materials (e.g., video recordings of the demo) as part of their assignment submission.
Grading Criteria:
The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of the Polkadot bridge.
Thorough testing and debugging of the bridge.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Effective demonstration or showcase of the bridge's functionality.
