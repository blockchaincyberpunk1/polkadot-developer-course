Substrate vs. Other Development Frameworks

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to promote critical thinking by comparing the Substrate framework with other blockchain development frameworks. Students will select another blockchain development framework (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Hyperledger Fabric) and conduct a comparative analysis, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of Substrate in contrast to the chosen framework in terms of ease of use, flexibility, and scalability.

Instructions:

Introduction to Comparative Analysis: Start by explaining the importance of conducting a comparative analysis when choosing a blockchain development framework. Emphasize that this assignment will help students gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of Substrate.

Selection of Blockchain Framework: Instruct students to choose one blockchain development framework other than Substrate. Provide a list of options if needed (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Hyperledger Fabric).

Comparative Analysis: Ask students to conduct a comparative analysis between Substrate and the selected framework. They should consider the following aspects and provide detailed explanations for each:

a. Ease of Use: Evaluate and compare how easy it is to get started with development using Substrate and the chosen framework. Discuss the availability of documentation, tutorials, and developer tools.

b. Flexibility: Examine the level of flexibility offered by both Substrate and the chosen framework. Discuss whether developers have the freedom to design custom blockchains or applications according to their requirements.

c. Scalability: Analyze the scalability features and capabilities of Substrate and the chosen framework. Consider factors such as transaction throughput, consensus mechanisms, and adaptability to different use cases.

Strengths and Weaknesses: Students should identify and provide a clear list of strengths and weaknesses for both Substrate and the chosen framework based on their analysis. Encourage them to provide specific examples or use cases to support their arguments.

Use Cases: Discuss the types of projects or use cases for which Substrate might be more suitable compared to the chosen framework, and vice versa.

Relevance to Course: Explain how conducting this comparative analysis is relevant to the Polkadot Developer course and how it can inform students' decisions when selecting a development framework.

Presentation or Report: Instruct students to present their comparative analysis findings in either a presentation or a written report. They should use clear and concise language to convey their points effectively.

Class Discussion: After students submit their presentations or reports, facilitate a class discussion where students can share their findings, insights, and engage in debates or discussions about the strengths and weaknesses of Substrate and the chosen framework.

Submission: Students should submit their presentation slides or written reports on the course platform by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Depth and accuracy of the comparative analysis.
Clarity in presenting strengths and weaknesses.
Application of specific examples or use cases to support arguments.
Relevance of the content to the course objectives.
